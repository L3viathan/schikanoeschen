# Schikanöschen

This repository serves as the official rules for the card game "Schikanöschen",
for the league of my family.

The rules are seperated into game rules (which concern single games) and league
rules (which concern the ranking system, tournaments, and changes to both rule
sets.

When in doubt, the German rules are binding, the English rules serve merely as
a translation.
